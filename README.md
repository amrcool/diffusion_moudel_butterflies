#Diffusion Model for Generating Butterfly Images
◦Implemented a diffusion model utilizing the advanced U-Net architecture to generate intricate butterfly patterns
◦Utilized a large dataset of butterfly images for training the U-Net model.
◦Trained the model to capture both local and global features of butterfly wings while preserving spatial information.
◦Employed techniques such as data augmentation and regularization to enhance model generalization.
